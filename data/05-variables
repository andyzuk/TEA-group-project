Group Project:

We plan to look at factors that influence parental involvement in their child’s education.  
We will identify the variables that we hypothesize are related to parental involvement.  
We will look at the variables using descriptive statistics to identify any potential issues, 
then we will analyze the data using cluster analysis and regression.  We will develop a report.
