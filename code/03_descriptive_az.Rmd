##This calls the packages needed:
```{r}
library(survey)
library(magrittr)
library(Hmisc)
library(dplyr)
```
## This selects the variables we plan to use and creates a new files with just these variables called PFI_TEA
```{r}
PFI_TEA <- subset(pfi_pu_pert, select = c("basmid", "grade","scpubpri","sneighbrx","sefuturex","fssportx", "fsvol", "fsmtng", "fsatcnfn", "fsptmtng", "fsatcnfn", "fsfundrs", "fscommte", "fscounslr", "fsfreq", "fcschool", "fcteachr", "fcstds", "fcorder","fcsupprt","FOSTORY2X", "focrafts", "fobuildx", "fosport", "forespon", "fohistx", "fodinnerx", "folibrayx", "fobookstx", "foconcrtx", "fomuseumx", "fogroupx", "fosprtevx", "HHPARN16X", "HHPARN16_BRD", "numsibsx", "pargradex", "raceethn", "hwelftan", "hwelfst", "hwic", "hfoodst", "hmedicaid", "hchip", "ownrnthb", "hvintcom","ttlhhinc", "AGE2015"))
head(PFI_TEA, 10)
attach(PFI_TEA)


```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Next, we produce some descriptive statistics to look at the variables and drop the valid skips
```{r}
describe(PFI_TEA)
```
##Now we will run some crosstabs
```{r}
mytable <- table(grade, fsvol)
```
## we will create a new variable that is a count of how many school parent activites a parent engaged in
```{r}
# schoolpart <- count if 1 in "fssportx", fsvol","fsmtng", "fsptmtng", "fsatcnfn", "fsfundrs", "fscommte", "fscounslr" and ("fsfreq >1") 
```

## we will create a new variable that is a count of the out of school activities a parent participated in 
```{r}
# homepart <- count if 1 in "fostory2X", "focrafts", "fogames", "fobuildx", "fosport" , "forespon", "fohistx", and ("fodinnerx >1), "folibrayx", "fobookstx", "foconcrtx", "fomuseumx", "fozoox", "fogroupx", "fosprtevx" 
```
## next we will create a variable that is a combination of the two participation variables
```{r}
#overallpart <- schoolpart + homepart
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{stan output.var=}

```
